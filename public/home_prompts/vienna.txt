Rate fit based on how strongly the applicant demonstrates: a drive to build ecosystems and communities rather than just individual projects; a natural instinct toward collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and lifting others up alongside their own work; comfort operating across multiple cultures, cities, or contexts and an ability to synthesize different environments into their creative process; genuine interest in bridging worlds — whether that means connecting scenes, industries, disciplines, or geographies — rather than optimizing within a single one; a preference for combining quality of life and deep relationships with high-output building, rather than treating them as tradeoffs; and evidence that they see their work as part of a larger mission to foster innovation and address real-world challenges within a supportive community of peers, not just ship product in isolation.
