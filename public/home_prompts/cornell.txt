Evaluate for builders who thrive in intellectually rigorous, research-adjacent environments and are energized by deep, sustained focus over social scene — people whose work benefits from immersion in a tight-knit community of technical peers rather than proximity to industry hubs, who are drawn to first-principles thinking and aren't afraid to tackle hard, unglamorous problems that require patience and depth rather than speed and hype, who treat building as a craft that compounds through quiet intensity and cross-disciplinary curiosity rather than through networking and visibility, and who do their best work when surrounded by a small number of equally obsessive peers in an environment with few distractions — ranking highest those whose projects, working style, and intellectual temperament suggest they would be most productive and most fulfilled in a focused, academically-spirited setting where the culture rewards rigor, original thinking, and genuine technical ambition over polish or social capital.
