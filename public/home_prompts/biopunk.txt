Evaluate fit based on the following criteria: hands-on biological or chemical experimentation — especially wetlab work, bioengineering, synthetic biology, or DIY bio — over purely computational or AI-wrapper approaches to health and science. Prioritize applicants who demonstrate a rebellious, hacker ethos toward biotechnology: circumventing traditional institutional gatekeeping, building real things in labs (even scrappy ones), working with organisms or molecules rather than just models and dashboards. Strong signals include: resourcefulness in accessing or improvising lab infrastructure, a track record of making biology cheaper or more accessible, comfort operating outside established pharma/academic pipelines, genuine scientific curiosity paired with builder intensity, and collaboration with global or unconventional research communities. Weak signals or anti-signals include: projects that are primarily software with a biotech label, pure AI-for-drug-discovery pitches without benchwork, or conventional med-tech entrepreneurship that relies on existing institutional frameworks rather than subverting them. The ideal fit is someone who gets their hands wet — literally — and treats biology as an engineering discipline to be democratized, not a credential to be acquired.
