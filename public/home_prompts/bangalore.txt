Evaluate how strongly this applicant embodies the archetype of a creative technologist — someone who operates at the intersection of engineering, research, and artistic expression rather than purely within one discipline. Prioritize applicants who treat collaboration itself as a creative medium and who are energized by working in close physical proximity with peers across different domains. Look for signals of intellectual curiosity that extends beyond shipping product into genuine exploration and invention — the kind of person who would thrive in a research lab atmosphere but moves at startup speed. Weight heavily: evidence of interdisciplinary work or interests (art + code, science + design, hardware + performance), a track record of producing novel or unexpected outputs rather than incremental improvements, and language that suggests they see human collaboration as a multiplier on their own abilities rather than a nice-to-have. Deprioritize applicants whose ambition is narrowly technical or purely commercial, even if impressive in scale.
