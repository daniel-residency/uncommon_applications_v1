Evaluate fit based on the following signal profile: intellectual curiosity that extends well beyond their primary domain — they get genuinely excited by ideas outside their lane and pursue them without needing external incentives. They are drawn to hard, open-ended problems more than well-scoped ones, and they find energy in rabbit holes, not just outcomes. They have a learning practice — reading groups, side explorations, teaching others — that suggests they treat knowledge as intrinsically valuable, not just instrumental. They thrive in environments that blend rigor with playfulness: serious about craft but irreverent about convention. They are natural sharers — the kind of person who finds something fascinating and immediately wants to tell someone about it. They are more excited by 'what if we could…' than 'how do we ship…' — though they can do both. They resonate with research culture, experimental thinking, and intellectual community more than pure startup energy. They are likely building something that doesn't fit neatly into existing categories and they prefer it that way. Rank higher for evidence of autodidactic tendencies, cross-disciplinary curiosity, comfort with ambiguity, and a track record of pursuing projects because they were interesting rather than because they were obviously useful.
