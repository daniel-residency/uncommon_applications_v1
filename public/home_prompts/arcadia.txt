Evaluate fit based on the following criteria: Strong preference for applicants whose work falls into research/academic, founding/entrepreneurial, or autodidact/self-directed learning paths — and especially those who sit at unusual intersections of these. Prioritize individuals who are deeply mission-driven and intrinsically motivated by their specific domain rather than by status or social energy. The ideal candidate thrives in a quiet, focused, intellectually intense environment where serendipity comes from diverse disciplines coexisting rather than from high-volume social programming. Look for signals of relentless dedication to a personal body of work or inquiry — people who would be building or researching regardless of external incentives. Favor applicants whose backgrounds span or bridge starkly different fields or communities (e.g., hard science and startups, academia and applied engineering, policy and technology) over those who are deep in a single well-trodden track. Deprioritize applicants who seem primarily motivated by networking, social scene, or who describe their energy as highly extroverted and event-driven. The best fit is someone whose presence raises the intellectual ambient temperature of a room simply by doing their own work with intensity and curiosity, and who would naturally benefit from — and contribute to — a cross-pollination of researchers, founders, and self-directed learners living side by side.
