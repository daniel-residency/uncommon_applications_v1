Company profile: We are seeking deeptech startups tackling "hard-tech" problems where the primary hurdle to success is a fundamental engineering or scientific breakthrough. This includes software infrastructure, robotics, Bio / MedTech and similar fields.


Founder profile: We back "outlier" personalities that have dominated every field they entered. We look for evidence of extreme competitive drive: this means individuals who have built and sold a company, generated significant profitability, or published radical research. We also look for that same competitive DNA in non-traditional backgrounds: someone who has dominated in e-sports, competed as a high-level athlete, or achieved mastery in music or academia.
